      "that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and\n",
      "crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than\n",
      "ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must\n",
      "avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely\n",
      "on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot\n",
      "understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has\n",
      "refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some\n",
      "secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.\n",
      "The English have not understood and cannot understand the\n",
      "self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only\n",
      "desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And\n",
      "what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has\n",
      "always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe\n",
      "is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg\n",
      "says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a\n",
      "trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored\n",

      "sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\n",
      "patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron\n",
      "Funke, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the\n",
      "womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna\n",
      "Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of\n",
      "a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,\n",
      "so she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\n",

      "\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\n",
      "to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that\n",
      "political and social topics were ended and the time had come for\n",
      "intimate conversation- \"I often think how unfairly sometimes the\n",
      "joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid\n",
      "children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like\n",
      "him,\" she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her\n",
      "eyebrows. \"Two such charming children. And really you appreciate\n",
      "them less than anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n",

      "\"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I\n",

      "face assumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at Her\n",
      "Majesty's and you were pitied....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\n",
      "awaiting a reply. He frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did all\n",
      "a father could for their education, and they have both turned out\n",
      "fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active\n",
      "one. That is the only difference between them.\" He said this smiling\n",
      "in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles\n",
      "round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse\n",
      "and unpleasant.\n",
      "\n",
